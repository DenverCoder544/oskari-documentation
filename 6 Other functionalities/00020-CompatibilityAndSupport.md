### Multi-screen support

The Oskari interface supports touch screens and is accessible on mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. However, there is currently **no** dedicated mobile or tablet-optimized version of Oskari (such as a mobile app). The geoportal is gradually being developed to work even better with smaller screens of mobile devices.

### Role-based user management

Some Oskari modules utilize role-based user management, allowing users with different roles to access specific functionalities. For example, only logged-in users can view certain layers or spesific user groups can add or edit map layers within the service. The spring security framework that Oskari uses can be customized to different use cases.

### SSO authentication support

Oskari supports authentication and implementing/hooking into different authentication solutions.
