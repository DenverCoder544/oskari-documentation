# Developing instructions

This section contains information on how to develop Oskari. 

In this context developing refers to creating new functionalities or configuring the existing ones. Developing can also mean configuring the back-end (server) of Oskari. 
* The configurations of the front-end include creating and editing the functionalities, which is basically creation or modification of **bundles**. The configuring of the front-end requires proficiency in JavaScript. A sample bundle is provided for the developers to use as a basis for developing or configuring new bundles.
* Making configurations to the server (for example, creating a custom Oskari server extension) requires knowledge of Maven, JDK 8 and Jetty. For server configuring, too, the developers can use a template of an Oskari server webapp.

This section begins with the general guidelines and best practices, then moves into more detailed instructions of creating bundles, configuring them, adding 3rd party JavaScript libraries and finally creating custom server extensions.

Before you begin to develop new functionalities, see if it is already done: [the unofficial Oskari bundles created by the Oskari community](https://github.com/oskariorg/oskari-frontend-contrib).
