# Application environment

This section dives into the basic framework of Oskari and further into the technical perspectives of Oskari's frontend and backend.

## Framework

An Oskari-based web application consists of frontend code for browser-based user interface and backend functionalities that are run on the server. The user interface is implemented in JavaScript and the server functionality in Java. Both, the frontend and the backend, are built with extensibility in mind.

An example for building your own service is provided as a template application that can be run as is and it enables an easy starting point for customizing the service.

The picture below shows the generic idea of Oskari.
